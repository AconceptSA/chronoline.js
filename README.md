chronoline.js
=============

chronoline.js is a library for making a chronology timeline out of events on a horizontal timescale.

Currently, chronoline.js only requires raphael.js to function. Both jQuery and qTip2 are also used for further extensions but aren't necessary.

To use it, provide a target element and an array of dates (possible ranges) with event descriptions, and it will render the contents of the timeline.

There are a variety of options provided, which you can see in the JavaScript itself. They are currently (and will likely always be) quite idiosyncratic and represent the degrees of control needed for the projects this has been used for.
